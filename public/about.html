<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In 2017, I joined VMG Software with a passion for design and a vision to contribute to the company's growth. At that time, there was no dedicated design department, and I embarked on a journey of self-driven learning.</p>

<p>Through dedication and commitment, I transitioned from a non-design role to become the company's go-to designer. I self-taught software and design principles, taking on design tasks whenever the opportunity arose.</p>

<p>Over the years, I honed my skills, collaborated with various teams, and shaped the visual identity of our products. Today, I am proud to lead the design department, crafting engaging experiences and helping VMG Software thrive in the competitive market. My journey is a testament to the power of determination and continuous learning. I am passionate about leveraging design to drive success and innovation in every project I undertake.
